Hi there! I’m a first year Master’s of Applied Statistics student at the University of Michigan. My approach to statistics is summed up by John Tukey’s quote: “the best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone’s backyard”. So far, I’ve had the opportunity to play in the “backyards” of plant biology and biostatistics. I'm excited to explore other fields using statistics!

Outside of statistics, my interests include hiking, camping, reading, and gardening. I also love exploring National Parks.
