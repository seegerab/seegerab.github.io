Under the direction of Professor John Keane Dr. Aklilu Zeleke, I held weekly office hours, met with students individually, and graded assignments for STT 231: Statistics for Scientists. In addition, I formatted assignments for GradeScope, an AI assisted grading tool, to help with the transition to online learning.
