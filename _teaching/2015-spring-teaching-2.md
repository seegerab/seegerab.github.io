Under the direction of Professor John Keane and Dr. Aklilu Zeleke, I held weekly office hours and graded assignments for STT 231: Statistics for Scientists. In addition, I modified assignments to be compatible with GradeScope - an AI assisted grading tool - to help with the transition to online learning.
